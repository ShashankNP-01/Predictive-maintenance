🔧 AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance
This project is a Machine Learning-based system designed to predict equipment failures before they occur. It analyzes machine sensor data such as temperature, vibration, pressure, load, and runtime hours to identify patterns and detect potential faults.

The system uses a trained ML model (Random Forest) to classify machine health status and estimate failure probability. A Flask-based backend API handles data processing and predictions, while a React frontend provides an interactive interface for uploading CSV data and viewing results.

By enabling early failure detection, this project helps reduce downtime, lower maintenance costs, and improve operational efficiency. It demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence can be applied to real-world industrial maintenance systems.
